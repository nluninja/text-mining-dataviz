Whey Protein Isolate 90,"What is Whey Protein Isolate? Whey Protein Isolate 90 is our highest quality whey protein powder and provides 23g of protein per 25g serving. This whey protein isolate powder is 90% protein and extremely low in fat and carbohydrates, with only 0.17g of carbs and 0.25g of fat per serving, making it ideal for those looking to lose fat and develop a more toned physique. It's a purer, higher end whey protein than our standard whey protein concentrate product GN Whey Protein 80, which contains more fat and carbs than isolate.  What's so special about your whey protein isolate? Whey Protein Isolate 90™ is one of the the highest quality whey's on the market today and is blended, packed and sealed for freshness in our state of the art production facility. This is what's known as an un-denatured whey protein isolate, so the protein within hasn't been damaged by heat and can be readily used by the body. It's a traceable product from free range, grass fed cows and is made from vegetarian sweet cheese. It's packed with all 20 essential and non-essential amino acids required by the body. It is also very low in lactose, with just 0.2g per serving, making it a better choice if you are lactose intolerant.  How will whey protein isolate benefit my training? Protein is important in our diet because our muscle cells use it for growth and repair. If you want to recover faster from training and build your muscles up, you need to consume plenty of protein, but that's much more difficult to achieve without protein powders. GN Whey Isolate 90™ contains a massive 22g of protein in each 25g serving, so 2-5 shakes a day can give you all the protein you need to get the results you want. It's packed with beneficial Branched Chain Amino Acids (or BCAAs) and glutamic acid, which rapidly reach the muscles and are used to encourage muscle growth and recovery. Our bodies are able to utilise a great deal more of the protein in whey than other protein sources, so it gets absorbed faster. This means it's great for taking before and after your workout, or as your first meal of the day.  How should I use GN Whey Isolate 90™? To help grow muscle and aid recovery after training it's recommended that you consume at least 1g of protein for every pound of your body weight. The average person therefore needs to consume about 2-5 servings of GN Whey Isolate 90™ every day. This product makes a smooth, creamy protein shake when a 25g scoop is added to water (or milk if you prefer) and shaken in our GN Blender Bottle. If you want a stronger or weaker flavour, you can simply add more or less water - anywhere between 150-200ml of water usually produces the perfect taste.  What's in this protein powder? Whey Isolate 90 is made from high quality whey protein isolate powder and a tiny quantity (0.4%) soy lecithin, which is added to help the protein mix well with water to produce your protein shake. The unflavoured version contains nothing else, but the flavoured ones also contain a natural flavouring, some natural colouring and a little calorie-free Sucralose sweetener to make it tastier. These flavourings, colouring and sweetener make up 3-6% of the volume, depending on the flavour chosen.  What flavours are available? Whey Protein Isolate is currently available in 11 flavours, with more being added all the time. We currently offer: Unflavoured, Blueberry Cheesecake, Jammie Biscuit, Key Lime Pie, Maple Syrup and Pancake, Rhubarb and Custard Sweets, Strawberries and Whipped Cream, Sweet Banana, Triple Chocolate, Turkish Delight and Vanilla Ice Cream. The Maple Syrup and Pancake is a particularly popular one with customers. All can be mixed with water or milk to make a smooth, creamy protein shake.  How does it differ from whey protein concentrate? Whey protein isolate is a much purer product which is harder to produce, which is why it's a little more expensive to buy. Unlike the cheaper whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate goes through an extra filtration process to remove fats and carbs to result in a much purer protein containing just 0.17g of carbs and 0.25g of fat per serving. By comparison, whey protein concentrate contains 19.5g of protein per 25g serving, plus 1.2g of carbs and 1.45g of fat.  What goes well with GN Whey Isolate 90? Adding 5g of Creatine Monohydrate to your post workout GN Whey Isolate shake can help to improve lean muscle gains, size and strength. BCAA+ are also another great option to provide vital amino acids when looking to limit your carbohydrate intake."

It can therefore help you recover quicker and build muscle more effectively.  Why should I take a protein supplement like this? Protein is an fundamental element of any athlete or training enthusiasts nutritional protocol. Put simply protein is essential for growth and repair of all cells, including muscle cells, and it is therefore necessary in order to experience training adaptations. The vast majority of us will struggle to consume the amounts of protein required for positive training adaptations through whole foods alone, and this is where GN Whey Protein 80™ provides the perfect solution. With over 80% protein and low in fat and carbohydrates it is the ideal way to increase your daily protein intake. Consuming the right amounts of whey protein will allow your body to recover more quickly, and grow. Speedy recovery means you're back in the gym sooner and reaping the rewards.  How often should I take it and how much should I use? We recommend consuming at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight every day if you want to improve recovery and gain more lean muscle. As a rough guideline, that's 3-5 servings of this protein shake every day. You can find out more on the Suggested Use tab.  How well does this protein shake mix? This whey protein is instantised using a small amount of soy lecithin which is negligible nutritionally (less than <1.5%) . Instantising ensures a finished protein powder that mixes effortlessly in your GN™ Blender Bottle to produce a smooth and delicious protein shake.  How is this whey protein concentrate made? Whey Protein 80 is an un-denatured whey protein powder sourced directly from Europe's leading dairies. Manufactured from vegetarian sweet cheese using a cross-flow micro-filtration process ensures that you receive only the most pure whey protein concentrate, packed with all 20 essential and non-essential amino acids. Processing is carried out at very low temperatures to ensure that GN Whey Protein 80 is un-denatured and highly bio-available.  What's so special about whey protein anyway? Whey protein is one of two types of proteins derived from cows' milk, with the other being casein. It is absorbed faster than other forms of protein making it an excellent choice pre and post-workout and after fasted periods (the first meal of the day). Whey protein has the highest biological value (BV) of any dietary protein and appears to have a synergistic effect with high GI carbohydrates, such as maltodextrin or dextrose. This is particularly recommended post-workout to increase nutrient delivery and glycogen replenishment. Studies have also shown whey protein to have benefits for weight loss through satiety.  What goes well with Whey Protein 80? To support lean muscle growth we recommend adding 5g of Creatine Monohydrate to your GN Whey Protein 80 shake. Creatine Monohydrate promotes lean muscle growth and increase in strength. Also try adding Maltodextrin to your post workout shake. Fast release carbohydrates taken post workout help to deliver the vital amino acids of the protein to the muscles and also replenish glycogen stores."
Volt Preworkout™,"What is Volt™? Our Volt pre workout formula includes 12 advanced active ingredients that work together to increase energy, mental focus and muscular pump. Volt enables you to achieve the ultimate workout so you can maximise your lean muscle, power and strength gains by training harder.  Who should use Volt™ pre workout formula? Volt is ideal for those who want to push themselves further when they're working out. However, it's potent and has a high caffeine content. It shouldn't be taken by children, pregnant or breastfeeding women or if you're caffeine sensitive.  What's in your Volt pre workout formula Our Volt pre workout formula comprises three main parts: the GN™ Vascularity and Pump Enhancer (based on AAKG and Citrulline Malate), the GN™ Power and Strength Matrix (based on creatine monohydrate, L Taurine and Beta Alanine) and the GN™ Energy and Focus Intensifier (based on caffeine and guarana extract). These two blends contribute to different aspects of improving your physical performance.  What is the GN™ Vascularity and Pump Enhancer? The GN™ Vascularity and Pump Enhancer provides 2g of Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate (AAKG) and 4g of Citrulline Malate which work synergistically. Arginine is a direct precursor to the vasodilator Nitric Oxide and has the potential to increase nutrient delivery to the working muscles. This is often described as the 'pump' feeling associated with intense training. Citrulline Malate is also reputed to enhance nitric oxide production, as well as being an ergogenic aid in it’s own right. Studies have shown that supplementation with Citrulline Malate at increased doses can increase training intensity and total number of repetitions (Wax 2015).  And the GN™ Power and Strength Matrix? Our GN ™ Power and Strength Matrix includes 5g of the premium creatine monohydrate, 2.5g of L Taurine and 3g of Beta Alanine, which work to increase maximal effort and reduce muscular fatigue and soreness. creatine monohydrate; is one of the most well researched supplements available on the market today, and has been shown many times to help increase power and strength during repeated, high intensity exercise. Daily supplementation with Beta alanine has been shown to increase carnosine production which is reputed to buffer lactic acid production to prevent the onset of 'the burn' and muscular fatigue (Trexler 2015). Finally, taurine is one of the most abundant amino acids in the working muscles and a popular ingredient in everything from over the counter energy drinks to powerful pre workout formulas such as Volt™. Supplementation with 2g Taurine per day has been shown to increase power whilst decreasing muscular levels of lactic acid and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) (da Silva 2014). Volt™ contains 2.5g Taurine per serving to help keep you pushing harder for longer.  What is the GN™ Energy and Focus Intensifier? GN ™ Energy and Focus Intensifier delivers a powerful blend of stimulants, vitamins and extracts designed to boost energy levels and enhance focus to ensure peak performance. Volt™ provides 389mg of caffeine through pure caffeine anhydrous and guarana extract; combined with over 1400% RDA vitamin B6, 1g of tyrosine and 500mg each of glucuronolactone and carnitine, all of which have roles in normal cellular energy production. Caffeine can boost both physical and mental performance (Cruz, 2015) and has been shown in studies to increase power output during cardiovascular and resistance exercise (Lane 2013, Astorino 2010).Glucuronolactone is a metabolite of glucose commonly found in commercial energy drinks. This can increase energy, alertness and reduce reaction times.  How should I use Volt™ pre workout? For an intermediate dose, add 12.5g (about four medium scoops) to 200ml of water and shake in your GN™ Blender. If you're an experienced user, you can try a higher dose based on 25g in 300-400ml of water.  In what flavours is Volt™ available? Volt™ currently comes in two flavours - Berry Burst and Lemon and Lime. We have worked tirelessly to ensure that Volt™ is not only the most affect pre workout formula, but also tastes great.
